Overall the device is good, and honestly is the reskin of one plus 8T with lower price üòÅ.  I will list down the pros and cons -pros -1. With Oxygen OS 11, the overall user experience is quite smooth. You will get an update as soon as you finish setup.2. The Warp 65 fast charging is fine, takes around 35 mins for one full charge.3. The screen to body ratio is good.4. The matt finish on the back side is awesome.Cons -1. Battery drains a little fast, not sure if some future updates will fix it.2. Rear Camera is ok, can be better.3. I would have preferred popup front camera, rather than the punch hole.4. For dual apps, I would have loved to see the option for all apps. Right now it has support for few.5. support for few more 5G bands will be good to have.',\n",

They're claiming it as a gaming phone and sorry to say that you can't use it as a gaming device. Also the camera is average. Please don't go for it as there are lot of other good smartphones in the market with same set of features for 40k. Big no from my side.

The camera I would say , is decent. It depends on your photography skills. The sensor specs only matter so much, I would say invest some time in learning photography. Check the photos attached. If you are a power user , this is one of the best value for money phones at this segment. For the custom rom folks , the kernel is open sourced, so in a year can expect decent ROM.

       " \"The only reason I went for Oneplus 9R is that I have been using Oneplus 5T from last 3+ years, the phone is perfectly fine till now and I always wanted to go with Oneplus for the upgrade after using Oneplus 5T and for its great user experience.Coming to the Oneplus 9R, I am not totally satisfied with the phone as I had higher expectations on Oneplus 9R. With the given features and upgrades I feel the phone is not doing so great. When you compare this phones with the similar range of phones from other brands you will have different opinions and thoughts.Pros:- Display quality is very good, with Fluid AMOLED Display and 120 Hz refresh rate display it is buttery smooth- Built quality is great, with aluminum body and Front and back Gorilla Glass 5 protection. Feels premium in hand- Phone speakers are doing well, sound is crisp, loud and with more details- Handset microphone is also great, Can hear the exact voice of the caller and it's clear and loud- Performance - Qualcomm 870 Chipset is doing well, phone is running smooth with no lags so far.- Front camera is good if you compare with other 16MP sensors on other phones.- As usual clean UI experience with Oxygen 11 OS.Cons:- Minor heating issues.  Felt phone was heating up during initial setup, while moving the files from old phone to new one. first 2-3 days felt phone is getting warmer with normal usage aslo and during the time of charging. I feel the heating issues resolved after receiving the first OS update or who knows the phone might be settling down after few days of usage.- Primary camera(s) is not up to the mark, photos can be seen only better in pro mode, videos are little better and front camera is OK. Lots of additional and unnatural colors are being added to the shot. There is no much clarity when you zoom and no details and images are scattered. Camera is not good with the hype which Oneplus created.  I wish Oneplus would be able to fix the camera issues with some good updates if hardware supports and if not then that's it.-Battery backup - Battery drains very quickly with the 120Hz refresh on, battery lasts only for 1 day with full charge and optimal usage. But the good thing is, it charges very quickly as well with 65W Warp charger. from 6 to 100 % took 49 minutes to charge.Overall, if you want to go with the display and performance other then Camera quality and some other issues which I highlighted, then you can go for it and if you are an Oneplus fan.NOTE: Whoever wants good Camera, they might think twice before purchasing this phone. You will get way better camera phones than Oneplus 9R under 40K (38 with discount).\",\n",
       " \"OnePlus did a blunder with this one. Battery quality is very bad. And it's charging very slow. I'm not sure it's some unit problem or software issue, so I've requested a replacement, but it states over 1 hour to full charge when it's already charged 60%. The charging rate is very low as well, and battery deplete very fast, I can say it depletes faster than it's charging rate.Screen quality is great.Sound quality isn't very good either, it has very less max volume, I literally had to keep it at full volume always for a decent sound.As for heating issues, as everyone else is stating, it's over heating a lot! While normal usage it overheats, let alone any power playing.Honestly, I feel OnePlus made a blunder here. I was really looking forward to this device. Let's see how the replacement unit feels.Edit - battery seem to be performing better after replacement. However, still have issues like overheating and speaker sound.\",\n",
       " \"Ordered Carbon Black; 12GB+256GB variant.Recieved a day early, on 19 April 2021.First Day Review:This phone is basically an 8T but with a Snapdragon 870, at a lower cost, but that doesnt mean they skimped on quality.So far from 1 day of use, this phone has been incredibly snappy and intuitive. Switching over from a Galaxy Note 8 was a piece of cake, although it took a good few hours to transfer the data.Charging is really quick as you would expect from a 65W WarpCharger.Camera quality is satisfactory in Auto mode, and gets better in Pro Mode with manual control.Speakers are loud and clear, and there is enough stereo seperation that it doesnt feel too unbalanced.Screen gets really bright and colours are accurate, haven't run into any rainbowing, Black Crush or Purple tinting issues. The 120Hz refresh rate also adds to the snappiness feel of the phone.Gaming is really enjoyable, especially those game that take advantage of the features like haptic feedback in COD Mobile. Speaking of which, the haptic motor (vibration) feels super crisp and tight, giving it a premium experience.I had gone for the Carbon Black, and the matte finish on the back glass is exactly what I had hoped for, and the matte finish also has an advantage of repelling fingerprints.So far the phone has been awesome, and I recommend it 10/10.Will update this review if I notice anything off :)\",\n",

After using 2 weeks, my review is OnePlus 9R is Average phone. Was earlier using Poco F1 for 2 years so comparing with Poco F1.Built quality OK but no premium phone feeling. Battery backup 6-7 hrs with normal office use but charger is quite fast 40minutes full charging. Camera is poor specially in night, camera quality is of 10000 phone. Minor heating problem during heavy use like gaming or major download but not deal-breaker. User interface is good, no unwanted pre-installed apps. But you get 90-100 GB storage due to pre installed system apps. Screen resolution is good,touch is quite smooth, no lagging or hanging. Stereo speaker is OK but not best. Phone weight is OK. 4G speed is slightly better in this phone, no call drop felt. But I don't find Wao factor (between Poco F1 vs OnePlus 9R. Sometimes Poco F1 is better.

This will work smooth.\\xa0‚Ä¢\\xa0Design and placement of Camera Module is the best the oneplus have done ever while it\\'s completely subjective, but youll get ü¶ç Glass 5 protection on front and back along with a aluminum chasis/side frame it\\'s a well built device simply rigid and feels premium to hold.\\xa0‚Ä¢\\xa0Haptic is best in the price range.\\xa0‚Ä¢\\xa0Dua Dolby Stereo Speakers make it loud enough to consume your content at any place\\xa0‚Ä¢\\xa0Full day power just in few minutes this device comes with a 65W wrap charge which will charge your device in just the time span of 30/35 mins. You\\'ll never fall short of power either it be powerful performance or the power interms of battery.\\xa0‚Ä¢\\xa0Oneplus\\'s Fluid Amoled display is best screen I\\'ve ever seen smooth responsive and vivid best for Netflix, lovers xD.Cons:\\xa0‚Ä¢\\xa0There are some bugs oneplus need to solve it as it isn\\'t justified for this kind of flagship devices. I\\'m mentioning few of them oneplus pls act accordingly.\\xa0‚Ä¢\\xa0While using YouTube  the framerate drops I don\\'t know it\\'s a google fault or what but even the notification bar seem to be freezing while scrolling down as to like 90fps. There are few more applications like Google photos application which I\\'ve discovered uptil now.\\xa0‚Ä¢\\xa0Phone get warms outside it might be due to the electronic devices catch too much of heat radiations from Sun rays.\\xa0‚Ä¢\\xa0Oneplus pls provide One-Hand mode as soon as possible as the device is having a large form factor it\\'s quite not possible for using the device single handedly even if I am having really large palms and long fingers indeed, I am just thinking anout those girls having small cute palms and fingersüíÖü§£üòÖ.\\xa0‚Ä¢\\xa0Now jumping to camera section one plus needs to work on the picture capturing algorithm the problems faced were like...\\xa0‚Ä¢\\xa01) Sometime captures undersaturated photos in potrait and 2x Zoom mode.\\xa0‚Ä¢\\xa0Need to work on the algorithm of focusing as it hunts for focus sometimes in the darker.\\xa0‚Ä¢\\xa0Basically Camera needed to be well optimized by oneplus in few aspects rather say camera performance is awesome just few bugs are needed to be solved. I\\'ve attached few pictures you can refer to those.Conclusion:\\xa0‚Ä¢\\xa0If you want a well built phone with best processing speeds and Video Capabilities you can opt for it it\\'s is the best device in my terms under 50k budget but few bugs and improvisation are required & I hope Oneplus will donit sooner or later.Thanks for reading my review.',\n",
       " 'You may get phones with better on paper specs at this price, but none have this quality. The build quality is significantly better than the competition. The frame is aluminium with a glass black and premium looking matte finish. Oxygen OS feels simple, practically useful and premium unlike those overwhelmingly bloated skins in Xiaomi, Vivo and Samsung phones. The phone has a great display, much better than the competition. The vibration motors are Iphone quality, not the usual cheap quality vibration motors found in the competitiors. The battery life is much better than advertised. I am able to get 6 hours of playtime on heavy games like COD Mobile on full charge. 65W fast charging is stupendously fast. No heating issues whatsoever even while gaming. Buttery smooth performance in daily usage as well as games. Idle battery time is amazing. The cameras are great but lack in colour calibration. Other competitors offer better cameras. Overall, Oneplus is the only brand offering clean software experience in this range, which is the most important thing in a phone.',\n",
       " \"It has been more than 3 months since i am using OP 9r. I have ordered it in first sale.So i must say everything is fabulous in this phone whether it is looks, performance, display Or Camera. Don't get confused when i say camera is great because many of the big youtubers have criticised its camera when compared it with Samasung galaxy s20 5G.So after seeing comparison i thought to switch to samsung galaxy s20 5G. So i decided to go to samsung store just to check if it is that good. And trust me guys, S20 looks way cheaper and like a normal phone. The time i took it in my hand i decided to stay with OP 9R. Even i have compared the camera as well and have not noticed any difference. So for normal users, if you are not a tech enthusiast, you won't be able to find any difference between two when it comes to camera. And please don't trust these youtubers. They are just making money by making us fool. Before making any decision just visit to the samsung or oneplus store.And as of now, i have not noticed any con in this phone. Everything is smooth specially the display. Also there is no heating issue but gets little warm during the charging. Battery life is also decent. If you are a normal user it will last one and half day. Also, it takes 40 to 45mins to charge it fully. So if you have the budget, then go for it. You will not regret it.\",\n",

       " \"Extremely slow and disappointing product. I have been using OnePlus since they launched OnePlus One. And this is by far the worst product I have ever seen for the following reasons1. Display screen blinking again and again2. Burning hot after just two hours of use3. Battery life is pathetic, only lasts 6-7 hours before needing charge again4. Unable to perform multiple functionsI would never recommend this product to anyone. I'm officially not a OnePlus customer after this.\",\n",
       " \"I have an OnePlus 3 and an One plus 8 and this this my third purchase of an oneplus phone in the family.A bit disappointed to hold the phone at first after using OnePlus 8 for almost a year now. First, the lack of curved edges deprives you of a smooth navigation gestures especially with the cover on. Further, it is not the slimmest phone in this price catagory. But not so heavy.Full marks to the Super-AMOLED display, which is super cool and crisp. Even in broad sunlight, it is visible because of the 1,100 nits it offers. Build quality is very premium. Ergonomically well designed. Perfect for one-handed opraration. The front and rear is of corning gorilla glass 5 and the frame is metal (where as for the OnePlus 9 the frame and rear are of plastic!!) Lucky me! So it looks very elegant. But no IP rating for water proof is disappointing. But company says it is water proof. The insulation in the SIM tray is an evidence.The phone is superfast with a great sensitivity for touch and swipe gestures with the Snap Dragon 870 processor. 120 hz refresh rate is super smooth. Gamers would love it with a top-notch haptics (vibration features) and with the 244 hz touch sampling rate.Battery charging is very fast too. The juice holds up for quite long because of the better power management by the latest processor and the LLDR 5 RAM. Delightful!! Occassional warming yes during heavy games. That's normal. Camera is decent. Front camera is 16 MP should be a 32 in this price range. Avoid beautification option as you may look like a cartoon. Rear camera takes above average photos in day light. But below average during low light/ nights especially the wide angle camera. But it has optical image stabilisation even the OnePlus 9 doesn't have that. So shaky hand fellows don't worry for the blur. Videos are of best quality. Best in this category. With a good video editor and skill you can make cinema like videos but the stabilisation is not-so-good in the nights.Stereo speakers are of very good quality. It is loud and doesn't crack even at high volumes. Call quality is decent. Not comparable with iPhones though. And Dolby audio is very enjoyable with headphones. With a good quality earphones/ headsets, I assure it is not less than a immersive audio experience especially for games.'Flip to mute' and 'raise the phone to answer' features are missing. Don't know why. It is just a OnePlus 8T with a good looking rear camera console with Rs.3000 less. Even the cover of 8T suits perfectly on this.So overall I am satisfied if not delighted. My OnePlus 8 is still better I feel. But this is the best in this price range. Better than the vivo x60, Mi11X pro or even the samsung S20 FE especially for the build quality and the premium feel it gives. Also the oxygen OS is best out of all android OS'. Also the in-display finger print sensor and the face unlock, I have not experienced  anything faster, prompter and more acuurate in recent times with anyother gadgets!! But the phone has only one 5G band. Suggest not to use the cover supplied with the box. It gives a kinda smoky look and makes the phone look bulky. But withstands accident falls. I have ordered the sandstone bumper case from the OnePlus store. Lake blue colour variant is awesome. Best of all the colors of all the OnePlus phones till today in my opinion. Catches not much finger prints or smudges like the 8 series. Scratch proof. Phone comes with a pre-applied scratch gaurd sticker. So no extra purchase required. Charging cable is a bit shorter than OnePlus 8. Type C charger with 65W charging adapter. 0 to 100 in 50 minutes. One significant change here is the data transfer to and from computer is quite faster than my OnePlus 8 also using OTG. Adaptive brightness they have got it right this time. In previous Oneplus devices, it was irritating. I have become loyal to OnePlus because the life of OnePlus phones is quite long compared to any other leading brands. My OnePlus 3 still stands formidable after 5 years. One star less just for the absense of curved edges display and a not-so-slim thickness. Else this phone is very good. Though corner of my mind says the price should be 10% lesser.P. S.Not encountered any overheating or battery draining issues as highlighted by some users. May be because I bought the phone after the release of first software update  and updated before writing this review. If you are not a fan of flagship processors and not a gamer, go for the OPPO F19 Pro with half of this price. Slimmer, lighter and with 3.5 mm jack.\",\n",

I am not a high end gamer but a general user, reading work emails, scrolling social media and playing card games.- The UI is amazing, very smooth as compared to 5T.- Camera is good at this range but not to be compared with phones which have camera as the sole USP.- Battery Backup is quite good with me staying on the phone all the time, it dropped from 100-30% in a day of full usage (and some board and card games)The options I compared before buying it:1. Samsung FE S20: Probably the only switch I could have done, but my experience with 5T helped me stay loyal to One plus.2. IQOO 7: Performance and feature wise, slightly better, lower price too. One plus suits social status and IQOO is a newer brand still building it's reportaire.3 iPhone 11: Old vs new dilemma, iPhone 12 was double the price.

When we swipe down from the middle or any other part of the screen .. earlier it brings the drop down menu..but now the this action brings the OnePlus quick menu. And the drop down menu appears only when swiped down from above. I hope it will be sorted out. Keeping these aside.. it's just OnePlus legend...\",\n",

This is very minimal and all of the other options are good.Battery - 4/5 - I am not a gamer and a single charge is lasting me for 1 days with calls, Internet browsing. The Wrap charger is awesome with ful charge in 45-50 minutes. Device heats up during charging at times and this is also small issue.Camera - 4/5 - Not a Camera enthusiastic and the Camera works pretty good for a normal users.Call quality and call connections are pretty good.Audio is pretty good and Video is a treat to the eyes with nice display.Cons - Nothing could I find until now but as everyone says 3.5 MM jack should have been there.',\n",

Have to charge multiple times in a day.3. 5G Bands- Freaking 1 band and they tell it‚Äôs 5G powered. Well Settled OP4. Camera- No words totally waste lens.5. Display- Superb Display Quality with smooth transition. 120HZ but drains battery quickly.6. Speakers- No words to express Dolby Atmos is fantastic super loud. Some times can feel vibration at back of the phone.7. OS- Very clean OS with similar Stock OS experience. But has some bugs in it.Conclusion- The OP 9R is only worth for 27k not more than that.

       " \"Coming from oneplus 6T, i was highly confused to buy a mobile. I have been using this phone for 15 days now and below is my experience so far:- This phone has brand value. For working professionals, after iphone and other true flagships in android (50k+ range), people recognise you the most with a oneplus device. The appeal on this one, specially blue color is really classy with minimalist branding- This is a pretty well balanced device overall. The processor is really smooth as it is a flagship processor. If you really want sd888, trust me go for oneplus 9 pro (if you can deal with average camera performance) or just wait for more device releases- the haptics are really solid. Before buying this phone online, i went to offline showrooms to get a inhand feel of all 35-40k phones, including samsung s20 fe 5g, oneplus 9R, mi 11x pro, iqoo 7. I really like the haptics of this phone.- The camera lacks some clarity but you really can shine your pics using snapseed. Even when you have an iphone, you still end up using a photo editor to make some corrections if you're really into taking good photos, so in terms of posting pics for online content you can get really good results.- Gcam mod is available for this phone, picture quality is better with the same- The punch hole is really non intrusive, you do not get bothered by it even when playing games or watching movies.- Audio output is really good. Dual speakers give you the surround experience- In hand feel is really solid and well built- The screen is really gorgeous, it is smooooth and produces vibrant colors.Under 40k, go for this one if you are looking for a balanced phone. Otherwise increase your budget and go with Samsung s20 fe 5g.\",\n",

It depletes by 2-3% over 7 hours if not used, but once you make a call or browse the net, it starts depleting like a bucket with a hole in the bottom.With the warp charger the charging is just a cakewalk.

That 120hZ refresh makes the device very smooth.Only downsides I have noticed are:Camera's (they are good but not good in this price range especially the selfie one)Battery drains a lot quicker. It is like if you want something you have to compromise on another, in this case for higher refresh rate you compromise with battery. This will need a refill in the evening when charged in morning, maybe this can be fixed through an update.\",\n",

Also heard a lot of negative reveiws about camera. Now I am not a person who'll look at intricate details in images and compare it to the iPhones and Samasung Galaxy S series.

Oneplus 9R device has the potential to perform better, only some tweaks in the software is required to improve its performance to the best.2. Overall the build quality of the device is very good, I have bought the carbon black 8gb / 128 gb variant and it seems to perform well. The device has got Snapdragon 870 chipset which performs well.3. I have played Call of duty mobile at full high graphics settings and the device worked flawlessly, without any lags or crash.4.

And Ultrawide is also too good.5) Metal body : This phone looks more durable as it has a metal frame which more costlier one plus phones don't have.6) Gaming : If you are a gamer and especially thinking of buying a gaming phones,just go for 9R.I have played some heavy games,Battery doesn't drain ... But It's heating a little bit which is common while in high graphics.Cons:1) In Camera,While taking a slow motion video, especially in daylight, Screen flickers continuosly... I have informed this issue with one plus and they promised to fix it in software update2) Doesn't have an IP68 Water resistance.3) No Hasselblad Parternship (Even though it doesn't matter a lot)Overall,If you are thinking of buying a budget phone below 40k,just close your eyes and go for it. This is the only one plus 9 series Phone which justifies its features with the price.This is why I have chosen this phone. If you are thinking not to buy phone because of some negative reviews,I strongly advice not to trust them because there are some people I know who are using it and it's good.

While there is this view that 5G is given in 9R just for namesake, I think it is sufficient. My most data consumption is at home and my Wifi takes care of 90% of my usage. This charger can probably charge an EV in 2 hrs - amazing speed. 12gb RAM is a spec I was pondering for a while but definitely helps me be future proof for atleast a while. Great screen. The from camera on the corner rather than middle is a great design element.I think if you are already in the 25k range segment it's a good step to get into 9R segment.\",\n",
       " \"Box contents are the phone, charging cable, good tpu case, and some paperworks.So I am a 1+7 Pro User and then this is my second OP phone because I like Oxygen OS and no bloatware unlike any other brands.I have used Xaomi, Motorola, Nokia, Samsung, Sony, Huawei and Redmi phones and I can say 1+ has the cleanest and simplest UI.It's fast and responsive and 1+ does provide updates which usually improves the phone gradually.The Build Quality is Fantastic. Feels Sturdy in Hand and very premium. I can say this glass finish on back is even better than my OP7 Pro. Loved it. Although It lacks the Symmetrical look from the OP7 Pro it still looks good.Battery drains fast but it's ok. Because u have 65w fast charger out of the box and believe me it's fast.  My mom loves the fast charging feature because she is always in a hurry and this saves her time. Last moment charging and juice to run a day is superb. 100% better than my OP7 Pro.Now coming to Display, it's a really good Screen. I must say I got jealous of the brightness. Felt better than my OP7 Pro at times. However saturation or is not less as compared to the latter, let's say probably 1+ decided to go with more of natural colours even  after display calibration. It's just a matter of preferance but I am sure no one will be disappointed by the screen.Sound is Amazing on all aspects be it speakers or headphones or even the earpiece. Crisp and clear. Speakers are fairly loud as well.Gaming is Epic The 120 Hertz screen does do its job well. All games can be played on high resolution and 90-120 Hertz.I tried COD and Asphalt. I can say it's better than my OP7 Pro.Now finally coming to the Camera. The picture of the Rose was taken from its main camera. Rest pics of the phone taken from my 1+7 Pro. I would let u be the judge of them.Finally I can say I am happy with the purchase.Just one Advise to all.

Camera, well camera works fine, not the best in class, gcam port gives you night mode in the front camera which you don't get in the stock app. If camera is not your main priority go for this or 8T, which ever you find at best deal, there's hardly any difference. In 8T you get covers and accessories comparatively easily. I got 9R with exchange and other offers at a very attractive price. Also i could have gone for iqoo 7 legend but stock android was my top priority which got me into taking 9R, if that is os skin doesn't bother you i would suggest you to go for IQOO 7, that is a better option with better camera and better price.

       " \"Pros:Premium Aluminium frame and glass back120Hz screenFlaghship level performanceGreat for gamingGreat cameras for the segmentWarp charge 65Cons:Minor heating issuesI have been using this phone for more than two weeks now. Very happy with the purchase, however, Amazon did take a bit longer to deliver this considering other Prime deliveries. My gaming is casual, but I did not notice major battery drain or heating during my usual 90 mins or so of daily PubG at UltraHD and ultra frame rate. The cameras are great, but color representation could have been more acurate compared to flagships. Low light images are great as well. The selfie camera isnt 'amazing' but is sharp and reprodues colors well. OIS works great. The phone feels really premium, and everyday usage is a breeze with apps opening and instaling snappily. The touch sampling is amazing. Battery backup is considerably good considering that I have had the screen at 120Hz since the day I got the phone. Warp charge 65 is a great aid. I have noticed minor heating, but the aluminium frame at the top edge gets considerably hotter than the back with intense gaming. Highly recommended purchase. I havent used the OnePlus 9, but most tech reviews I consulted were speculative about if it is worth investing 10K more on the 9 instead. Lake blue is really beautiful!\",\n",

The main advantage of OnePlus nowdays is the \"OXYGEN OS\". THE PERFECT, CLEAN AND NO AD OS out of the box. Nothing is perfect and yes even this device it\\'s not perfect but ideal device! It\\'s the best device for day-to-day usage. People have been complaining about the camera in the previous reviews but I believe there was nothing so bad as stated in the review. This phone has got a decent camera but it works pretty fine and it\\'s perfect at it\\'s view. I haven\\'t seen any heating issue so far. Yes while using camera the device gets little warm at the back but it looks down immediately after the application is closed. And the WARP charger is a master piece. I don\\'t have to wait for my phone to get 100% charged for a long it as it charged up in 30mins. It fast, flawless and convenient smartphone. Coming to the 5G thing, as OnePlus claims this device is 5G ready, but giving just 5G and claiming the phone is 5G is a complete disappointmrnt according to my point of view. Keeping these aside the device is an all-rounder overall you can go with the device no problem! I am satisfied! üåà',\n",

Feels very premium in hand . I've the lake blue color and it looks very subtle and elegant too.(2) Call quality and network reception- Call quality is also very good , never faced any voice lag or poor network signal. Earpiece quality is very good so no problem there.Regarding network I always get 4G+ in my city wherever I go and the download speeds are also very good. Regarding 5G this has only one 5G band that is N78. If you want a 5G future proof phone then this is not for you and if you need 4G phone with powerful specs then this is fine.(3) Display and Audio - Display is very good. The 120HZ smoothness adds the AMOLED display another star. I've watched HDR videos on YOUTUBE and NETFLIX too no problem. Watched movies , normal videos no problem there no black crush , green tint issue ,etc in my unit. 120HZ is working fine never experienced any framedrop. Stereo speakers are also loud and clear enough.(4) Performance - Day to day performance is very good and gaming performance to. Thanks to Snapdragon 870 it handles this device very nicely . I've played CODM and BGMI in max settings and never faced any framedrop. After 30 mins of gameplay of CODM and BGMI the back feels little warm but no overheating. The max temperature after playing for 2 hours was 41¬∞C and that's totally fine because I've used smartphone who gains 45¬∞C after an hour so no complaints there(5)Camera - Here's what I found the back camera needs improvement a lot. In day time it clicks average photos . I'm not a camera lover but if you're a camera lover you should go with S20 FE 5G. The ultrawide is good doesn't shifts the color and details are pretty good. Better than those 8MP ultrawide cameras. Macro is usable but not that great . And 2MP depth sensor is type of useless. Front camera is decent though. Regarding video back camera 4k 60fps with OIS pretty good. Front camera only has 1080p 30fps which is pretty decent .(6)Battery and Charging- Charging is very fast 0-100% in around 40mins . Regarding battery if you're a normal user and in 120Hz will give u more than a day . If you're a heavy user like me then you've to charge it for the second time in a day.(7) Software- Oxygen OS my favourite UI bloatware very less only Netflix and some OnePlus apps are there . Didn't noticed any bugs yet. OnePlus promises 3 years of Android updates and 4 years of security updates so that's also very good.Conclusion- - I've purchased 8GB 128GB lake blue color frome great Indian festival sale by exchanging my old phone. So if you're getting this at price of 30k by exchanging your phone then it's totally value for money at 30k . If you need a 5G proof and better camera smartphone then you should consider s20 FE 5g. If you need 4g phone with great specs then this is for you.\",\n",
       " 'Recieved it today..I am using OnePlus 7pro from last 2 years and i mist say it is a tough competitor to my 11pro max in terms of photography...whereas this 9R is no way near to my oneplus..after collaborating with COLOR OS oneplus have downgraded their flagship experience..ywo different mode of shooting pics.i.e 12MP and 48MP no zoom and wideangle in 48MP, portrait mode is pathetic,colour saturation and vibrancy are nill..one star only for macro shots...if anyone is purchasing this for photography purpose i urge them to stay away from this 44k blunder..u will find nothing flagship inside the phone..u will feel like u r using any oppo aur vivo smartphone in oneplus branding..*EDITED*MACRO SHOTS ARE VERY GOODNIGHTSCAPE WORK EXCEPTIONALLY WELLHAVENT FELT ANY HEATING ISSUES IN NORMAL USAGEBATTERY LIFE IS GOODREFRESH RATE IS AWESOME',\n",
       " 'During Unboxing-To be honest the first impression about the 9R was totally on the Opposite side except for the design side.During the initial setup, I never experienced such a thriller as the phone was getting warmer by every minute. Thanks to the Oxygen OS update 11.2.3.3 which made a huge difference on the same day of unboxing.Seriously, The phone reached a peak temperature when the new update was getting downloaded and installed and during charging as well (Seriously, At some point, I had to leave the phone for a safer distance... funny but TRUE).Thanks to the 1+ teams effort to solve the \"UnUsual\" heating issue.Now after Two weeks of usage and even after many heavy usages the phone never got warmer so i think this will continue (fingers crossed).Pros :1. Display - 120Hz - Now I am damn sure that I can never go back to the lower refresh rates screen phones. The phone\\'s display is silky/Buttery smooth (Take whichever you like). The adaptive / Dynamic refresh rate option is a good one that actually saves battery by optimising it based on the usage.2. Camera- Never had a complaint so far. Got a lot of options especially in PRO mode. The end result of a photo (Quad of Selfi) can directly relate to the amount of light that the camera sensor gets when you press the shutter.3. Performance - 870 chipset is really good. No problem so far and it is highly efficient in managing the RAM especially when playing Games.4. Oxygen OS - Got released (First 1+ phone for me) when started using this phone OS as it is free from Ads and other Bloatware especially the installed/suggested Apps.5. Charging- Charging experience is named perfectly as \"WARP CHARGING\" really good option to have and it fills the battery from 0 to 100 well under 45 mins. No heat observed during charging.6. Battery - So far so good 1.5 to 2 days of battery life between charging with moderate usage( 5 to 6 hours of screen usage). For me, this device didn\\'t die within 1 day. I don\\'t mind if the phone runs out of charge by end of the day as it has Warp Charging a must for all the devices.7. Haptic motor-Very good touch and feel when the motor vibrates feels premium.Con:1. Pricing - Price could have been much more competitive at the end of the day not only the corporate should feel good about profit but majorly the end customers should feel good about the purchase.Finally, as a one-liner I can say, An all-rounder device packed with all the Essentials/Expected points for this present trend but if you can afford it.',\n",

I m not a professional photographer, so for me it's absolutely good.3) Fingerprint sensor works fine.4) Facelock opens even at dim light.5) Phone doesn't heat up during regular use. I observed heating only during initial system update and also while charging which is obvious. Otherwise NO heating issue.6) Comes with wrap charging n charging speed is good.7) Battery performance is good. We have an option to change refresh rate from 120Hz to 60Hz.8) Touch is smooth, and display is excellent.9) Sound quality is awesome.10) Quick gestures response is very fast and I loved it.11) Came with good packaging.12) Back case quality is transparent n goodOnly cons are,If call recording is started, opposite person get intimated about it. Ofc i never do call recording so I don't mind about it.No 3.5 mm jack in this phone just like other costly phones.

       " \"Reason why i have chosen this to be not so flagship will sum up this point as i proceed,9r is overpriced device. No doubt it comes with 870g Snapdragon processor but it lacks other points as well, no doubt in hand feel makes it to another level. but as soon as we launch camera app it ruined the expectation of flagship, display is good not great but colors are punchy and vivid while playing 4k Videos. Heated initially completing the process but we get update out of the box, after update also camera quality is not that good. Its OIS and focus is not good, I know that I shifted from samsung S8 that is remarkable except burning issue and their pathetic service. Hence I decided to switch but S8 is just way more premium till now. Look wise 9r is truly flagship device, but below average camera shown that device is not worth at all.****************65 Watt charger : Its bulky and not portable, don't know why they bundled brick like adapters. comparing it with samsung 25 watt which I think more sensible, because to carry this charger you need space so in that way user,s may end up buying case or bag for  itüòÇFluid amoled : Its not impressive as super amoled of samsung, might have worked on it.Refresh rate : As stated smooth lag free experience, some amount of lag is there initially while application update. That,s quite normalBuild Quality : Here I need to say that device stole heart in terms of look, metal frame. smooth Matt finish, it feels premium without case. 5/5Camera : even real me is having good camera within 15,000, subjects are completely missing. Optical image stabilization is just another marketing gimmick, Camera is poorFingerprint : brilliantBattery Life : Initially assuming battery life is not right, will update this section.Speakers : loud and clear, stereo speaker enhance multimedia experience. Good for entertainment.Conclusion : Verdict is still missing few essential points like gaming and heating, which can only discovered after the usage of device. Initial impression not that good, but yes clean and blot free oxygen OS is better than miui, color os. so let me complete here that device is good for those who want it considering perfomance oriented device, premium feel, super fast charging, good display and speaker can for media consumption. Go for it anyday.I also attached 4k video samples that is truly adorable, camera is important factor is a huge disappointment. Never ignore this important aspect, sharpness will truly outlastThat is the reason I gave 3 stars\",\n",

       " 'Will be mainly comparing to IQOO 7 legend and Samsung M51. Purchased 18th Dec, 2021.1. Supports Netflix HDR content which is exclusive for highend phones. Samsung M51/52 or A71 etc does not support. Neither does IQOO7, 7 Legend or Motorola edge 20.I love when camera is on side and not center, helps a lot while watching online content.2. Sound is better than almost any other phones. Clear and Loud.3. Oxygen OS is good. Heptic feedbacks, Zen mode etc.4. Camera quality is good. I do like the result of IQOO7 Legend better but then again its display is better in someway too. More shiney and huge.5. Build quality seems better than Samsung M52. Its lighter than both IQ7L and M52.6. HUGE CON : The welcome pemphlets of box are referring to this device as a gaming phone but it dont make sense. It heats up immensely while playing game for even 10 to 15 mins. Games like Thetan Arena or PUBG India.In between the facts that 1+ battery blow ups with Nord devices a couple of times that made the news, and this phone heating up so easily, I find myself a bit anxious while using this phone especially for gaming. For general use it wont matter I belive. Point to note is : Not just the back of the phone(esp areas surrounding the camera module) heats up, but also the screen, and The Basel is Heated up to the point you consciously notice it. Its a concern for sure as I have not noticed the edges and even basel getting noticably hot in any other phones, but luckily I do not plan to game a lot on this phone.7. No headphone jack.8.

OnePlus you need to up your game, or u r gonna be next nokia. Should have opted for mi 11 ultra for another 15K+ which is comparable to the likes of galaxy s21 ultra.\",\n",

Phone came with a crappy transparent case, which is of no use - its as good as no case. They want you to buy the sandstone case, they are famous for (or were)2. Single band 5G, not sure if it will work at all3. Camera - yew, the magnification is so limited and the processing is so bad, that ultimately its noise that you see and not the picture. Close ups in portrait mode, does a lot of color processing making you wonder if this is the photo you took in the first place.OnePlus has lost its reputation it once had, many phones are much better out there (I must say, I never sweated about having a Oppo Reno other than the fact that it was quite big and heavy!!)\",\n",

Oxygen os made the overall usage excellent, highly optimised with a great balance of customisation. As someone who enjoys music and occasional games, I found this device to be amazing. Gets slightly warm when playing cod on maxed out graphics, but very manageable. It's not noticeable with the case provided in the box. I usually go on meetings for 1.5-2 hrs a day, haven't faced a problem with the call quality even once. Vowifi works brilliantly on Airtel in HYD. I found the display to be brilliant color reproduction wise. But I wished the highest brightness were slightly higher under direct sunlight, and the least brightness a lot lower-its way too bright for my liking in a dark room. I was slightly disappointed with the camera, but after using an Asus zenfone max pro m1 since it's launch, I can say this still is not bad at all in ideal conditions. Music output through wired earphones is amazing with Dolby Atmos, just the way I imagined a flagship to be. Earlier reviews mentioned average battery life. After the initial ota updates, I managed to extract 7+ hrs of screen on time consistently with the haptics turned off and 60hz refresh rate, with~20% remaining after 24 hrs. And the best part is, it charges up to 100% in less than 30mins. lastly, I haven't noticed any heating issues after the initial ota update. Coming to 5G, this device only supports one band- when the name prouldy includes this tag.Sorry for the long review, but this would be a 10/10 device if not for the slightly average camera and the lack of multiple 5G band support.

But that's a separate problem.This 9R I bought on 29th May n put to use from 7th June onwards I must say the phones performance is underwhelming. The said 120hz of speed is actually not felt at all.

It keeps switching between apps while typing more often and that's damn irritating.Overall my recommendation is to NOT go for this at the price point as the performance claimed is not what you get.Am happy with warp charging though, it's r ally quick than any predecessor.

It's just good for a day's normal use.The phone had severe heating issues, like seriouslyüòë, it's ok if it gets heated up during a gaming session but during watching YouTube at 1080 p and Netflix, watching ig reels, n during online shopping like for realüôÑ. The phone gets really hot when charged.Coming to charging, I was actually baffled by the fact that the phone gets fully charged within 34 minutes (prolly the reason why it gets heated real bad) other than that hats iff to 65w charging.Other than that the OS provides a really user friendly experience and provides more customisation to your preference and tastes.The camera is flawless and am not disappointed, but low light selfies can be better.The phone's build is so sturdy and really premium in hand with a metal frame and gorilla glass on the front as well as back.Note: The black 9r provides a matte finish back aka frosted glass and the blue 9r provides a glossy finish.This was my opinion of the phone, as a whole a really good and potential phone with minor tweaks and updates it may take its place in the flagships.\",\n",

I have no complaints regarding the hardware. But I haven't recieved any security updates for over a month now ( may security updates running in July end). On the other hand other 9 series devices are getting those updates. Keeping double standards is not at all a good practice. Adding to all these 5g bands is just limited to 1 no. Even though Nord 2 has almost 5+ bands & company made a statement that no further bands can be added via software patch... selling a device as future proof is cheating in this angle. MI 11 sells for well under 30000 having same or better spec (display).... keeping the good things like the software experience & general goodies a so called flagship offers is good...but comparing to other devices which offers same specs with almost 10000or even much less with offers is too much to pay forSo plz don't buy OP+ devices...it is not that old OP  anymore specially with color OS integration & not at all vfm\",\n",

To be honest I have never felt the need to use the 60hz mode as battery easily lasts the entire day for me.I am giving 4 stars as the phone could have been 4-5k cheaper or they could have bundled it with wireless earphones because you have to buy it anyways.

I did compromise a bit on the presence of phone but it is really a good buy.Camera is nice.Light weight (compared to OnePlus 7 pro)120hz refresh rate is really awesome.Battery charging is much quicker.

Fluid display is awesome, thoughtl i have used only limited time in 120Hz (to save the battery), I can very well notice the difference.4. SP 870 is simply superb, met my expectations.5. Volume and Power buttons are of great quality and gives nice feel to press.6. Aluminum fishing is lit. Gives premium feel.Cons:1. Heating issues - not very much but noticable. When you use camera, it gets heated even more easily.2. Charging speed is not like what they have advertised. It takes 50-60 mins to charge full. Disappointed with the false promises.3. Screen flickering issues while using telegram, notifications, and picking calls. (Hope they'll clear this in next update)4. Screenshots are not of great quality. My old mobile takes clear screenshots than this.5. When you tap 'Mark as read' chat notifications of telegram, they'll be still there. Don't know why.6. OnePlus lancher is consuming more battery.Over-all worth purchasing. Looking for an update where these small issues gets clear.\",\n",

Overall 8/10 for camera.‚Ä¢ Figer print and face unlock is 10/10. Even with your mask of specs it will recognise you.Battery life is great.‚Ä¢ Charging the phone is suprising super fast. Just 15 min you are good to go. Also, since phone is packed with feature, it do lose battery life bit faster then normal.Overall , it is indeed a good investment in the price.',\n",

       " \"I only bought 9R because Samsung Galaxy S20 FE  5G was out of stock and I needed a phone urgently. OP's glory days are long behind now. After using 8T for 6 months, and 9R for 10 days, here's my review and comparison:1. Display is great, slightly better than 8T. 120 Hz drains the battery too fast. I use it on 60 Hz.2. Battery backup is average on 120 Hz. Great on 60 Hz. I can easily pull of more than a day on average usage at 60 Hz. At 120, I have to charge twice a day. Played CoD Mobile for 5 hours straight with only 30% drain in the battery at 60 Hz.I saw a 75% charge in 30 mins. For some reason, 8T charges faster than 9R. But 9R has a slightly better battery backup than 8T in my case.3. Heating was minimal after the update. Only during charging does it heat up, which is normal for most phones. Even during gaming, the heating wasn't that much, unlike what other users have been complaining about.5. Rear camera is great but underwhelming in low light. Depends on the photographer's skill. Front camera is quite average. Front camera performs badly in low light. Overall, cameras are slightly better than 8T. Or maybe it seems that way due to the better display.Video recording from the front camera is below average and the lack of functionality was disappointing. I can only shoot in two aspect ratios at 30 FPS only. Video recording from the rear camera is good with options like Portrait mode, super stable mode and super slow-mo available. The lack of options in aspect ratios with 60 FPS was another disappointment though.OIS is available in 9R but not 9?! OnePlus is making some seriously stupid business decisions.6. The lack of 3.5 mm jack has been A MAJOR INCONVENIENCE. Good luck finding a connector that lasts long. Or you could buy their earbuds, thats what they wanted you to do anyway.7. Only one 5G band? What is even the point in giving 5G then? Again, stupid. I don't see this phone viable after 2-2.5 years after this when 5G hits the market. Once 5G rolls out, Telcos will reduce the bandwidth for 4G and this phone will sit there like a showpiece. All depends on if n78 band is supported or not. And no, future updates won't fix that, OP has confirmed.8. Phone performance is great though. Everything runs quick and smooth, like you would expect any phone at this price to. Gaming performance is also top notch.9. The fingerprint reader is a little less responsive  than I would have expected. I've seen better response times on some of the smartphones costing ‚Çπ20K. But it is still fast enough.9. The OS is clean and well-optimized. The ambient display options and other customisations are great, just like the 8T.10. Ergonomics are exactly similar to the 8T. But I found the Arctic Blue colour way better than 8T's Aquamarine Green. The Arctic Blue colour looks simply gorgeous.Overall, this phone is not that bad. Kind of good actually, but OP is not the flagship killer anymore. It is trying to sail through only because of its brand value. And lack of innovation and some obvious features is just plain confusing to me. No wonder the previous CEO quit abruptly. If you care for the slightly better camera, display and processor, buy 9R over 8T.Buy a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G if you have a little higher budget, you'll get your money's worth in terms of almost everything. But please don't go for the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro, they're plain bad.\",\n",

If we record the voice it's audible and notification is heard. No point of record with notice. This is little defect.6. Most important and exciting part is gaming.

If you have not used a op device before, then you wont notice this difference.* battery: battery capacity is better than oneplus6 under certain conditions - 1. Display should be in 60hz refresh rate. 2. No heavy usage. I am following these 2 conditions and I am getting 6 - 8 hrs screen-on-time consistently. If you game or if you use 120hz, then battery drains faster and you get 4 - 5hrs SOT (this is expected). As everyone is saying, if you use certain applications for more than 30mins, battery heats up (not gaming apps, I am talking about normal apps like social media or browsers)* camera: is ok (better than op6). But if you are buying this phone only to take pictures, then dont buy this. Go for pixel/samsung/iphone.First review: Sold my OnePlus 6(which was still a beast but the volume button was not working properly) and bought this phone. If you have used a OnePlus phone, then this phone will satisfy you.Pros of this phone *for me*:-Oxygen os (fast & minimal)-Camera (compared to other flagship phones, camera is not that good but it's really good compared to OnePlus 6)-Charging speed (really fast charging but there is some heating issue)-Speaker/sound/mic/call quality (very good compared to OnePlus 6)-Very minor heating while gaming (played cod for around 40 mins, the phone heated up maybe 1 or 2 degrees compared to normal temperature)-Display (for the cost, display is excellent)-Fast processor (in practical usage, you won't see that much difference between Snapdragon 888 & 870)-No defects/bugs/issues except for the heating issue while charging-Battery (I'm not a hard-core gamer/user and I easily get 1 day battery)Cons *for me* :-No headphone jack (it was there in OnePlus 6 \\U0001f972. If you use a Bluetooth earphone/headphone this is not a con for you)- No LED light/indicator\",\n",
       " 'During initial days ,there was a heating issues but after updates , there is no such heating issues even after using for 2-3 hrs continuously. During charging also, no such heating issues.Warp charger works great. Full charge in around 50 mins.Phone is working very smoothly. Matte black finish gives it a very royal texture.Camera quality is also nice.Battery - even after heavy use,20%battery still remains .  Again warp charger is there. 15 min and it is 50% charged. Ready to work.All together, phone is not bad. Happy with the phone.',\n",
       " \"Here's what I think.- The OnePlus being highly customisable is hence one of the best phone manufacturer in the industry. OnePlus 9R being mainstream of the company (For India but still is mainstream) for the April Launch it's made with thorough power and state of art equipments and components.- As being said customisable the camera is best in class hardware which if used with other than stock camera app can be more better than present best (Samples above are from stock camera app)- If your usage is rough and tough this is the piece you should get.....Metallic frame, Metallic camera bumper, Non fingerprint magnetic back (matte finish), decent crafting for in-hand  experience etc. Overall more than premium feel and more than expected protection.- Display too good and you can expect still better in coming updates (OnePlus' serious about updates you know)- Gamers you have a value for money rough and tough phone here, Hard usage, no issues- Battery life is more than decent. Screenshot of my own device is up there. See it you'll just wanna buy it.\",\n",

Don't get me wrong the camera is decent but it's not as good as other phones at this price range.[Tip: You can use gcam to get better camera experience in this device.

       " \"The phone has been absolutely wonderful to use. I will list some pros and cons below.Camera(Con)- One thing this smartphone lacks is decent rear camera. In open areas with natural lighting it takes some wonderful shots, but in artificial or indoor lighting it is absolutely poor and blurry. The front camera is also not that good and if you are looking for a phone with good camera system, this might be a deal breaker for you. Another option is to use Gcam, works really well.Software(Pro)- This was one of the major reasons I went for this phone over the Iqoo cos of Oxygen OS, safe to say its one of the best OS I have ever used and for me, there were a little bugs here and there, however overall nothing major.Gaming(Con and Pro)- This was a phone designed for gamers with the SDG 870. Have had no issue of frame drops or stuttering while playing games. The problem is, it doesn't support playing games at 120Hz even with games which can run at 120fps. For some that might be a deal breaker.Heating- I have seen some reviews where people are complaining about heating issues. I did face about 42¬∞C while playing some games. The thing is SDG 8XX series chipset have always had heating issues. The 888 has an even worse heating issue. So if 40+ degree temps scare u I suggest not buying a Snapdragon 8XX series phones.Display (Pro)- This display at this price point is really good. I have had no issues with it personally. Like the colours are definitely better than the last phone I used. The screen is just bright enough that you can see it in direct sunlight. Can't be a little more bright tho.Fingerprint reader(Pro) - The in-display fingerprint scanner is one of the fastest and unlike the OP 9 and 9 Pro is positioned in a much better spot. Sometimes has trouble detecting fingerprint, otherwise have had no problems.Speakers(Pro)- These are the best speakers you can get at this price, both the speakers are really loud. So much that I normally don't use them at a volume higher than 60 percent.Battery Life- I use 2 Sims and am a very heavy user, I tested it once and it gave me around 7.30 hrs of screen on time with 120Hz on, which is pretty decent for a phone with a powerful chipset. The 65W charger is also there to charge your phone in 15-20 mins from 40-100 percent.Some things I wanna add is that it has a really good haptic feedback, it's not buzzing like the Xiaomi phones, it's a much more firm vibration.Hopefully this review was helpful in your decision of purchasing this phone or not.\",\n",

Screen time depends on the usage like camera, gaming, full brightness.Don't fall into the trap of reducing the refresh rate to save battery, it makes no sense if you have brought a phone for a feature and not using it.

Refresh rate makes your phone super smooth when you use the phone/ switch apps/content etc. (By the way it also consumes more battery power for that)2.Battery lasts for a day (24-30 hrs) for Normal usage (3 hours calls, location is off mostly, brightness is 60%-70%, 3-4 hours app usage-Whatsapp, YouTube, Prime etc).3. You could feel the speed difference because of the latest Sanpdragon chip combined with the refresh rate.4. Few innovative features, for example when you charge the phone over night, the charging pauses automatically after sometime and resumes by early morning to save the battery from getting over charged.5. Warp charge - a real speed in charging, soo fast.Cons:1. Bright issue - even after switching off auto brightness, the phone screen dimps to 10% brightness & revives to the set brightness level (say 60%). At times this is frustratingüò†, because you might be working on something and the phone screen brightness dimps and revives within 3-5 seconds. (Update: The problem still persist after the latest update - OS 11.2.6.6.LE28DA)2. Compared to the older OnePlus models, the new OnePlus 9R is so sensitive for smaller drops (Accidently dropped my phone from my trouser pocket while I was sitting in a chair and the phone's back panel cracked. Even for such smaller distance drop, the back panel crackedüò≠üòû. But the advertisement shows a different story). Replacement cost - 5k-6k to replace my back panel, yet to decide on replacement.3. Phone heatup- when you have longer calls/ games for more than 30 min-2 hours, the phone heats up.4. Unable to find any phone bumper cases (black/ sandstone) in OnePlus store/website for 2-3 months now, it's always out of stock. It seems they are focusing accessories mostly for 9\\\\9 pro and the model 9R is left on the wayüòü\",\n",
       " \"Writing this review after 2 months of usage..Pros:1) Oxygen Os with SD 870 gives you smooth performance as always2) Battery backup is good with min 5 hrs of screen time with above normal usage.With heavy usage battery backup is only for 4hrs of screen time.3) On design perspective it is pretty cool but the camera body is slightly above the flat surface which might get scratches when the phone is placed on flat surface.But we can use camera protector/hard cases to avoid this.4) Haptic feedback is good.5) one plus 9R has a metal body over the circumference.6) Gaming is pretty cool to play even with high graphics.7) Speakers are really good....Crisp and loud.Cons :1) There is a software glitch which I have noticed very rarely.2) charging time is not up to the mark as mentioned.It is taking hardly 50 to 1hr. However it charges quickly in airplane mode and in power off mode.3) Camera is not up to the mark compared to 9 and 9 pro since it misses hasselblad but it's not too bad.4) Notification in the headphone mode setting is not working actually..even when we restrict the ringtone in the headset it rings.May be this can be fixed in next software updates.5) It supports only one 5g band whereas 9 and 9 pro supports two band.But the band n78 is supported in most of the countries.If camera is not much important for you then you can blindly choose this mobile. üòÉ\",\n",

       " \"First time using OnePlus device ever in my life and the feeling i can't express in words it's just wow lelel of experience... the screen quality camera charging gaming everything is just buttery smooth on this device and oxygen os completely fulfill my imagination of always thinking about oxygen os features it's just wow go for if u have 40k budget ‚ö°üî•üî• at first am confused about buying OnePlus 9r or iqoo 7 legend then go for OnePlus 9r for getting better experience and always remember iqoo has funtouch os which is the most irritating os i had used previously\",\n",
       " \"I have been using this phone from past 1 month and it's a good bang for buck . One plus always makes good allrounder phones and this one is no different . Processor is good although it's not the top tier but it does its work . Battery life is really good and charging speed too . Although same old story with the camera but it's usable but not to a person who wants a phone for the camera . Gaming performance is really good , I have played a few titles ( pubg , cod , genshin impact etc...) And there isn't fps drops , just a tad bit , combined with the 120 hz fluid amoled it really bumps up the experience . Overall my thoughts that if you are a one plus fan 9R is the most value for money you will find in the OP 9 series . Final rating are -Performance 8.5/10Battery 9/10Charging speed 10/10Camera 6.5/10Display 9/10Build quality 9/10\",\n",
       " \"I am writing this honest review after a week's usage. This is my first one plus phone. Was using realme XT prior to this.First of all the packaging and delivery by Amazon deserves a 5 star.Below are my observations- Build quality is very good and sturdy with Alumium casing.-Display is very good. 120 Hz is very smooth to use.-Battery life is little above average for this price if you are a heavy user. Games drain the battery faster than expected. However the 65w warp chager charges the phone very fast and hence this nullifies the disadvantage of battery life. So not too worry about the battery.-Call quality is excellent-Camera is average for this price- fingerprint reader is best- sound quality is very good. The dual speakers is very good experience for watching movies . Dolby Atmos is an added advantage while using headphones- Performance is ultimate feature of this phoneOverall this is a good phone. People can opt for it but its overpriced at least 5k to 6k over and above its actual worth. If cameras were made better it would have been a definite value for money phone.\",\n",
       " \"No dobt it is powerful phone. You can experience the power of the processor at every action. At 120Hz the phone's performance is simply awesome. Network and WiFi coverage is excellent. Shortcomings are battery drains very fast at 120Hz. Camera quality doesn't meet standards of flagship phone. Overall its a phone of performance lovers and gamers. 1 star less for camera and 3.5mm headphone jack. At this price point these features must be there.\",\n",
       " \"Heat issue, call recording issue. So many features which you may not like.If anybody is looking to buy this.Pl contact me I m ready to sell out at a low cost, this phone doesn't suits my need.Leave a remarks and I will contact you back.\",\n",
       " 'Good design, better feel in hand, good camera (colours are bit over exposed), fingerprint sensor is quick, display is super. Only issue with battery life. 5G just for name with only 1 5G band.',\n",
       " \"Switching from Samsung S series was a tough decision to make. But after going through multiple online vlogs and reviews I finally made up my mind to buy one.The touch screen is an absolute delight to use, the phone charges really fast with 65w charger. The data transfer between old and new phones is hassle-free using OnePlus Switch App. The camera's quality is good enough but don't expect DSLR quality pictures. The touch and feel of the phone are delightful.\",\n",
       " \"Battery life is as good as expected, need to charge for only 30-35min (as it has 65W charging), and you can use it for a day.Camera is also good, no questions for camera lense.Suggestion :- Need to upgrade camera lense, as they are using the same since op 6.Value for money :- For 38k it's a flagship phone, as it comes with Snapdragon 870, 65W charging, in built finger print scanner, fast face unlock, and many more things.\",\n",
       " \"I ordered an One Plus 9R 5G and received delivery yesterday (19/10/21). I had ordered the one plus device based on my past good experience with One Plus 6 and One Plus 7 . However I didn't find the product value for money. On the 1st day of use itself I found the camera quality not upto the mark. The Picture quality was not good and I am highly unsatisfied. Also i had requested the customer care for return of the product and initiating refund on the same day (19/10/2021). However I was told the product can not be returned as the policy has been changed to only 7 day replacement only from earlier 7 day replacement/return. I am really not able to understand how can Amazon impose such a costly product on the consumers. This is such an ultra basic thing that one can comment on product quality only after use and in this case it has been made non returnable which is not just wrong but goes consumer rights to informed decision making. Kindly don't waate your money on the device. I further request Amazon to make the device returnable.\",\n",
       " \"The phone works flawlessly except for some ocassional heating , camera is ok , performance is very good , heats up when used for a longer duration bit it's kinda like luke warm. User experience is very good due to oxygen OS and display quality is good , does not have any tinting issues. Battery drain is minimal but felt it as I came from a bigger battery phone. Charging for 0-100 40 mins as I observed. Good phone for day to day usage.\"]"
